Hitchhikers Guide to Git - tricks, snippets, best practices and lessons for Git (source control)

## Resources
Most of the stuff in this guide should be applicable in general no matter your source control strategy. Where it deviates, I am always using the [**Gitflow Workflow**](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) unless otherwise explicitly stated.

I highly recommend the **Gitflow Workflow** strategy for source control, as documented by *Atlassian* [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)

***WHY?***
It's extremly easy to follow, makes sense (important!), and is designed to handle working in either a solo or team-based development environment
